### Road Map

- Enhance the code coverage on unit tests
- Ehnance user input validations
- Enahance UI/UX

### Approach
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). So followed the default application folder structure.
- Since the application is simple, I tried to keep the things simple as possible. I didn't use any external libraries other than react and it's related dependancies.
